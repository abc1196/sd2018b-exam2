### Expected results
* Develop artifact automatic building for Continous Delivery  
* Use libraries of programming languages to perform specific tasks   
* Diagnose and execute the needed actions to achieve a stable infrastructure  

### Used technologies
* Docker  
* CentOS7 Box
* Github Repository
* Python3
* Python3 Libraries: Flask, Fabric
* Ngrok  

### Infrastructure diagram  
The desired infrastructure to deploy consists in three Docker Containers and one Docker Client with the following settings:

* Python:3.6-slim CI Server: this CT has a Flask application with and endpoint using RESTful architecture best practices. The endpoint has the following logic:   
  * A Webhook attached to a Pull Request triggers the endpoint.  
  * The endpoint reads the Pull Request content and validates if the PR is mergedd  
  * If merged, via the Docker Python SDK, the endpoint runs the required commands to build the Docker Artifact and push it to the local registry.  
* wernight/ngrok Ngrok: this CT creates a temporary public domain name to expose the CI Server's endpoint.  
* registry Registry: this CT is a private local registry where the created artifacts will be pushed.  
* Windows 10 Home Docker Client: this Docker Client will be used to pull the private registry's artifacts.

### Introduction  

The current branch contains two key elements to deploy the infrastructure. The first one is the docker-compose.yml. This file contains the provisioning required for each CT. The second one is the ci_server folder that contains the Dockerfile and python script to build the CI Server Docker image.  

#### docker-compose.yml  
 To start, the docker-compose.yml contains three services, briefly described above

```
 ngrok:
    image: wernight/ngrok
    ports:
      - 0.0.0.0:4040:4040
    links:
      - ci_server
    environment:
      NGROK_PORT: ci_server:80
```
This rervices refers to the Ngrok service. It uses the wernight/ngrok Docker image, attached to the 4040 port and it's linked to ci_server in its 80 port to expose the CI Server's endpoint.  

```
  ci_server:
    build: ./ci_server
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```
This service refers to the CI Server service. It uses the Dockerfile (explained later) located at ./ci_server to build the image. It has a volume related to the Docker Machine's docker.sock to run the docker commands inside the endpoint.  

```
 registry:
    restart: always
    image: registry:2
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    environment:
      REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR: 0.0.0.0:5000
      REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE: ./certs/domain.crt
      REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY: ./certs/domain.key
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/certs
      - ./data:/data
```  
This service refers to the private local Registry. It uses the registry Docker image, attached to the 5000 port. It also has two self-signed SSL certificates created with OpenSSL. These certificates are located at ./certs.  

#### CI Server 

The ci_server contains two key components to deploy the CI Server. First, it has the Dockerfile to build the proper image.  

```
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.6-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
This Dockerfile uses a python image (based on Debian) as a parent image. Copies the folder's content to the /app folder in the CT. The image install the required libraries from the requirements.txt file. Exposes the server in the port 80 and finally, runs the app.py script.  

```
from flask import Flask, request, json
import requests
import docker
import os
import socket
```  
To begin, the app.py script. It begins importing the required libraries like docker and flask.  

```
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    html = "<h3>Hello!</h3>"
    return html

@app.route("/abueno/exam2/api/v1/images", methods=['POST'])
def build_image():
```
Next, the script creates the Flask app and defines some routes. The important one is build_image(). This one is the endpoint to build the artifacts from te Github repository.  

```
def build_image():
    content=request.get_data()
    contentString=str(content, 'utf-8')
    jsonFile=json.loads(contentString)
    merged=jsonFile["pull_request"]["merged"]
    if merged:
        sha=jsonFile["pull_request"]["head"]["sha"]
        imageUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc1196/sd2018b-exam2/"+sha+"/image.json"
        imageResponse=requests.get(imageUrl)
        image=json.loads(imageResponse.content)

        dockerfileUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc1196/sd2018b-exam2/"+sha+"/Dockerfile"
        dockerfileResponse=requests.get(dockerfileUrl)
        file = open("Dockerfile","w")
        file.write(str(dockerfileResponse.content, 'utf-8')) 
        file.close()
        tag="192.168.99.100:5000/"+image["service_name"]+":"+image["version"]

        client = docker.DockerClient(base_url='unix://var/run/docker.sock')
        client.images.build(path="./", tag=tag)
        client.images.push(tag)
        client.images.remove(image=tag, force=True)
        return tag
    else:
        return "Pull request is not merged"
```
First of all, the method begins by taking the HTTP Request content in a JSON format. Next, it checks if the PR comes from a merged PR (merged variable). If it's not merged, the method returns that the PR is not merged. Otherwise, the image.json and Dockerfile from the Github repository are downloaded to the CT; Then, a tag for the artifact is created; Finally, the Docker Client is created to use the Docker commands and the image is created, pushed to the private registry and then removed from the Docker Host.  

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```
Finally, the flask application runs int the port 80 and listens to any IP address.
